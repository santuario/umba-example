# Umba - Code example

[TrackStreet](https://www.trackstreet.com) has built an industry leading SaaS platform that leverages the power of artificial intelligence and automation to radically reduce brand and pricing policy violations.

For this purpose, a series of web crawlers downloaded the information of different products in a series of online stores (BestBuy, Amazon, Target, ...) to analyze their price, description and image. As a Data Scientist, to know if a product belonged to one of the clients, I had a supervised text classification problem, and my goal was to investigate which supervised machine learning methods was best suited to solve it.

### Objective

* Need a way to choose between models (different model types, tuning parameters, and features).
* Use a **model evaluation procedure** to estimate how well a model will generalize to *out-of-sample* data.
* Requires a **model evaluation metric** to quantify the model performance.

### Review of our model evaluation

* **Model evaluation procedure**: K-fold cross-validation
* **Model evaluation metrics**: F1 Score

### Agenda

1. Reading a text-based dataset into pandas
2. Vectorizing our dataset
3. Building a model
4. Comparing models
